# Website Basics Spring 2018
This class has been created as an introductory course for K-12 school age participants to engage and become familiar with the construction of websites. After attending this course, students should be familiar with certain components of html that include but are not limited to links, navigation, and adding content such as pictures, paragraphs, etc.
